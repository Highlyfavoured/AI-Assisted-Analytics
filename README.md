Introduction

The AI-Assisted Learning Analytics Data (2024/2025) provides a comprehensive overview of how students across different educational levels leverage artificial intelligence to support their academic activities. Built using Microsoft Excel, the dashboard transforms raw interaction data into meaningful insights, highlighting usage patterns across tasks, disciplines, student levels, and learning outcomes.
Its primary objective is to help educators, administrators, and stakeholders understand where AI tools are most impactful, how students engage with them, and the outcomes of such engagements.
Data Story
This dataset captures individual AI-assisted learning sessions during the 2024/2025 academic year, detailing how students across different educational levels and disciplines interact with AI tools. Each record represents a single learning session, including the student’s level, discipline, session length, number of prompts used, task type, AI assistance level, and final learning outcome. The dataset tells a story of AI functioning as a learning companion—supporting students through complex academic tasks, improving workflow efficiency, and contributing positively to learning outcomes when used in a balanced and purposeful manner.

Methodology

The analysis employed descriptive analytics techniques, including:
	Frequency and count analysis to determine dominant usage patterns
	Aggregation by student level, discipline, and task type
	Comparative analysis of AI usage levels and session outcomes
	Visualization using bar charts, donut charts, and trend lines
No predictive modeling was applied; the focus was on identifying patterns, trends, and performance indicators.

Pre-analysis

This step was carried out to ask some potential question that in order to get the hidden insights into the effect of AI usage on the performance of students. Some of the question and insights that aid the analysis are: 
	Identify the Ai assistant _level based on the student academic level and determine the academic level that utilize ai majorly 
	 Identify the total number of prompts by student in various level 
	Discover the session length across student level and detect the cause of inconsistent or disengaged students with very low seasons
	 Identify the academic discipline that require more interaction and its edge over others
	Identify the academic discipline that require higher level of AI assistant more frequently  
	 Discover the task type that demand the most struggle from student 
	 Identify the task type that consume the most time per session
	 Discover the effect of the use of AI assistance consistently on the on the final outcome of the student task
	 Identify how higher prompt volume led to better outcome and show comparison between students who achieve results with fewer versus many prompts.
	 Identify the most engaging Discipline on the use of AI assistance over time

Insight summary

	Writing is the most AI-supported task, indicating that students rely heavily on AI for essays, reports, and content structuring.
	Undergraduate students are the primary users of AI, accounting for the highest volume of interactions compared to high school and graduate students.
	Biology records the highest number of AI prompts, showing strong adoption of AI in content-heavy and concept-driven disciplines.
	Moderate to high AI usage levels (levels 3–4) are associated with the highest engagement, suggesting optimal usage occurs at balanced levels.
	Most AI interactions lead to productive outcomes, with assignments completed or ideas successfully drafted.
	A smaller but notable portion of users still end sessions confused or giving up, highlighting gaps in guidance or AI effectiveness.

Key Observations

	Task Preference Pattern
Writing and studying dominate session lengths, showing that AI is used more for sustained academic work than for quick tasks like brainstorming or research.
	Student Level Behavior
Undergraduate students show the strongest dependence on AI, likely due to heavier coursework and greater exposure to digital learning tools.
	Specific Discipline Adoption
Biology, Engineering, and Computer Science lead in AI usage, indicating that AI tools are particularly valuable in disciplines requiring explanations, problem-solving, and conceptual clarity.
	Outcome Effectiveness
The majority of AI-assisted sessions result in assignment completion or idea drafting, proving that AI contributes positively to academic productivity.
	Usage Efficiency
Engagement peaks at mid-level AI usage and declines at the highest level, suggesting that excessive reliance may reduce learning effectiveness or efficiency.

Recommendation

	Strengthen AI Writing Support for Graduates: Since writing is the most used AI-assisted task among all the students, AI platforms should provide advanced writing features (academic tone, citation support, summarization, and editing tools). Workshops or tutorials on effective AI writing use can further enhance productivity.
	 Expand AI Adoption in High School Programs: High school students showed strong engagement with AI (17,956 prompts). Therefore, Schools should integrate AI literacy into curricula to guide responsible use, especially for research, problem-solving, and writing.
	Encourage Balanced AI Use Across Disciplines: The narrow gap in AI adoption between STEM and humanities suggests AI is valuable in both. Institutions should design training that covers discipline-specific applications (technical subjects: coding, math modeling; humanities: essays, critical analysis).
	 Improve Assignment Completion Support: AI assistance is most effective for assignment drafting, but many students still give up (≈13,000 cases). Introducing step-by-step guided workflows, motivational nudges, and persistence reminders can help reduce drop-off rates.
	Provide Faculty and Student Training since engineering and computer science show high adoption, training faculty to integrate AI responsibly into coursework ensures consistency and prevents misuse.
